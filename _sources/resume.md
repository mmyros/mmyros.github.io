## Testimonials
> After working alongside Max for three years at NIH, I must say he is a great to work with Data science wizard, who has the gift to transforms complex data and problems into meaningful and impactful insights. I wish I could incentive him to move to Europe.
> 
> _Johannes Passecker, Assistant professor, Medical University Innsbruck_

> Max was my Teaching Assistant in a summer school in 2020 where he guided us to learn Machine Learning techniques useful for Neuroscience. Not only was he a great teacher during the school, he stayed with us long after the school day was over to clarify and make us understand the concepts clearly. Even after the entire school was done, he helped our group of 4 students in submitting our project to a conference to which it was accepted! His hard-working and amiable nature will be a great asset to any employer.
